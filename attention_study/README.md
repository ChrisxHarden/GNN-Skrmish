First, follow the instructions in figure8squad/README.md before following the instructions in this README. Once you have sigma_graph and its dependencies installed, follow these instructions to run the tsp/attention model tests.

# setup
If on Linux (Mac might work too):

1. make sure that figure8squad/attention_study is root folder
2. run ./setup.sh

Otherwise (or if it doesn't work):

1. make sure that figure8squad/attention_study is root folder
2. run the following commands (or their analogues for your OS):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd libraries/
pip3 install -e .
cd ..
```

# running tests
**To run baseline tests:**
`python3 generate_baseline_metrics.py`

Currently, only baselines for ppo and a2c are being used while some issues with pg and dqn are being worked out -- however, previous tests with pg and dqn trainers showed results consistent with baseline_values.png.

**To run the tsp/attention model tests:**
`python3 metrics.py`

The top of metrics.py has a number of settings that you can tweak while running the tests (the TEST_SETTINGS variable).

# seeing metrics
You must run tensorboard to see metrics generated by the above commands. The easiest way to do that is to run:
`tensorboard serve --logdir logs_directory`

`logs_directory` varies based on which tests you run.

For baseline metrics, the logs are stored at ~/ray_results/
For the tsp/attention model tests, the logs are stored at attention_study/logs/
